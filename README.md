This website is a submission for design heist
Link to the hosted website : https://ni-vik.github.io/Sandworm_OTT-Platform/
Link to the design submitted in round 1 : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1--INwNoWnjCCuvG4r9K6_oMX35qmabSm?usp=sharing
On this website there are 5 pages
1. Sign Up 
2. Log In
3. Home page (Which is the main page. Because of time constraints I was not able to add some features like media info below it's poster)
4. Movie view page : On home page in fantasy section there is poster of dune if you click on that you will be directed here)
5. MOvie play page : Click on watch now in movie view page and you will be directed here.
I was not able to make the website responsive so it will look like a mess on other devices other than laptops.
Thank you very much for organizing "design heist".
I learnt a lot during this period.
